<h2> About Me</h2>

<h3>I am a Junior at EWU pursuing a BA in Visual Communication Design. I am an avid skateboarder, and I recently quit smoking cigarrettes by vaping, which has turned into another hobby of mine. I enjoy exploring my beautiful state of Washington via hiking, especially with my girlfriend Jessa.</h3>
    <br>
<h2>Goals and Aspirations</h2>
    
<h3>I would like to first, graduate with a degree in visual communication design. Following that I want to land a design job somewhere in Portland, where I can live with my girlfriend, as she teaches Art. I want to have my own chunk of land, and build my own style of housing somewhat like a tiny home.</h3>

<h2>Eragon</h2>
    
<h3>This is my favorite book, simply because it is the most well written fantasy adventure book I have ever come across. I'm not much of a reader actually, but the fact that this book is so large yet kept me flipping pages is why I think it's one of the best books of it's kind. </h3>
